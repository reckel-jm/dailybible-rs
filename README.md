# Dailybible-rs is a Telegram bot for reading your Bible dailyâ€“and cover to cover in one year.

Dailybible is a Telegram bot which will send you a Bible reading notification for every day of the year. If you follow this Bible reading plan 365 days along, you will have made it through the whole Bible.

The source code is written in Rust and a rewrite of an older Python bot. You can try it out and use it for free at [@biblereadingscheduler_bot](https://t.me/biblereadingscheduler_bot). Follow the instructions below if you would like to host the bot by yourself.

## Environment Variables

In order for the bot to run, you'll need to set at least the following environment variable:

 - `TELOXIDE_TOKEN`: The token which you received from Telegram "Bot father"

In addition, you can add the following optional environment variables to adjust the configuration:

 - `RUST_LOG`: The log level which you would like to enable (`error`, `warning`, `info` are possible)
 - `TELOXIDE_USERSTATEFILE`: The file path of the file where the user states will be saved

## Run with docker compose (recommended)

The easiest way to run the bot is via the official Docker image which is generated automatically from the master branch. 
To do that, create a file `docker-compose.yml` and an empty folder `userdata`. Fill the `docker-compose.yml` as following:

```yml
services:
  dailybible-rs:
    image: archchem/dailybible-rs:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      TELOXIDE_TOKEN: ${TELOXIDE_TOKEN} # Replace this with your Telegram bot token, or use an .env file
    volumes:
      - ./userdata:/app/userdata
```
Now build and start the container via `docker compose up -d` (no root required).

## Compile and run it in Rust

```sh
cargo run --release
```
